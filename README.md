### Design and Philosophy:
This was a fun little project. 

Most of the heavy lifting is done in index.html and style.css - 
In index a series of DIV cards remain hidden until revealed by JavaScript. Javascript also powers the tracking of the score and the timer element. 

Ultimately there are still a few features I'd like to add if my time allows, like replacing "Most Recent Score" with a more robust "High Scores" page, now that I've expanded my understanding of using Local Storage.
